## Swift Package Manager
Note: Instructions below are for using SwiftPM without the Xcode UI. It's the easiest to go to your Project Settings -> Swift Packages and add Moya from there.

To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, without Xcode integration, add the following as a dependency to your Package.swift:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/Zean-Technology-Co-Ltd/TaoBaoSpider.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
```
